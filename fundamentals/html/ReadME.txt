Now, I have divided html course into modules, remember everything I have included 
here is with a purpose. Follow the modules in sequential order. Keep each question
in a seperate file and name it properly like
	"Q-01.html"
IMPORTANT: Use 01 at the back and continue numbering as it helps the files to get
sorted well inside the file explorer.

Organize folders correctly. Eg.: Place questions Q-01.html of module01 of html inside
	<html> -> <module01> -> Q-01.html
where, <...> is a folder.

READING SEQUENCES INSIDE MODULES ARE LISTED AT THE SAME FOLDER.
